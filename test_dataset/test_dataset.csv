Judge rules to allow evidence of Alex Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes in double murder trial,230206100452-01-murdaugh-trial-0203.jpg,https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/06/us/alex-murdaugh-trial-monday,"{'Dakin Andone', 'Alta Spells'}","Updated : 9:02 AM EST, Tue February 7, 2023","{'type': 'p', 'content': ['The judge in Alex Murdaugh’s double murder trial on Monday ruled to allow the state to present evidence of the now-disbarred South Carolina attorney’s alleged financial crimes, which the prosecution contends were about to be revealed and provided him a motive to kill his wife and son.', 'The decision came after days of testimony from witnesses who were heard without the jury present as Judge Clifton Newman weighed the admissibility of the evidence of the alleged schemes, for which Murdaugh faces 99 charges separate from the murder case.', '“I find that the jury is entitled to consider whether the apparent desperation of Mr. Murdaugh, because of his dire financial situation, threat of being exposed for committing the crimes for which he was later charged with, resulted in the commission of the alleged crimes,” Newman said.', 'Prosecutors indicated in pretrial filings they believed Murdaugh killed his wife, Margaret “Maggie” Murdaugh and his 22-year-old son Paul Murdaugh to distract attention from those alleged crimes, which the state asserts were about to come to light when they were killed on June 7, 2021. He has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.', 'Alex Murdaugh hid settlement of more than $4 million from family of his late housekeeper, her son testifies', 'Newman’s ruling is a blow to the defense, who fought the admissibility of the evidence in the murder case, claiming the fraud cases are irrelevant to the question of Murdaugh’s guilt in the murders of his wife and son.', 'While proving motive is not necessary, “the state must prove malice, and evidence of motive may be used to prove it,” Newman said in explaining his decision.', '“In this case, since the identity of the perpetrator is a critical element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, evidence of motive may be used in an attempt to meet that burden,” he said, adding the evidence was “so intimately connected” with the explanation of the state’s theory of the case “that proof of it is essential to complete the story.”', 'Over the last several days, the state called a parade of witnesses who testified in camera, or outside the jury’s presence, about the allegations against Murdaugh and the state of his finances when his wife and son were fatally shot on the family’s property in Islandton, South Carolina, known as Moselle.', 'That included testimony Monday from attorney Mark Tinsley, who was suing Murdaugh at the time of the killings on behalf of the family of Mallory Beach, the 19-year-old killed when a boat – owned by Murdaugh and allegedly driven by Paul Murdaugh – crashed in February 2019.', 'At the time of his death, Paul Murdaugh was facing charges of boating under the influence causing great bodily harm and causing death. He had pleaded not guilty, and court records show the charges were dropped after his death.', 'Tinsley was seeking a settlement in the civil case but had been told by Murdaugh’s defense attorneys he was broke and could only “cobble together a million dollars” for a settlement. Tinsley didn’t believe that, he said, testifying he knew Murdaugh was handling a lot of cases.', '“I know that he’s actively making money, and you just can’t possibly be broke, not the way he was making money,” he said. “Beyond that, I mean my clients have known Alex and his family forever, and so their perspective is that there’s generational wealth as well.”', 'Tinsley offered a payment plan, he said, but the defense objected and Tinsley filed a motion to compel that, were the judge to rule in Tinsley’s favor, would have forced Murdaugh to reveal his accounts, he testified.', 'A hearing on that matter and others was scheduled for June 10, 2021 – three days after the murders – Tinsley said Monday. But it was delayed when Maggie and Paul were killed, something the attorney framed as a deathblow to his civil case against Murdaugh, telling the court, “I recognized that the case against Alex, if he were a victim of some vigilante, would in fact be over.”', '“When you’re asking for a money judgment, people have to be motivated to give you that money judgment,” Tinsley said. “If you represent Attila the Hun versus some sweet old grandmother, nobody’s gonna give Attila the Hun money, but they would give money to some sweet grandmother.”', '“So if Alex had been victimized by a vigilante, nobody would have brought a verdict back against Alex … so I would have ended the case against Alex,” he said.', 'The prosecution has pointed to June 10, 2021, as a “day of reckoning,” when the hearing might lead to Murdaugh’s alleged misdeeds being exposed. But in their cross-examination of Tinsley Monday,  Murdaugh’s attorneys sought to undermine that argument, suggesting June 10, 2021, did not herald that reckoning.', 'The motion to compel just one of a “pile of motions” that would be heard that day ahead of a potential trial that might be weeks or months down the road, defense attorney Phillip Barber said.', '“The gist of this is that there was perhaps going to be this Judgment Day, I think is the term the state used,” Barber said. “But that was going to be trial, right? That was going to be the verdict. That was going to be Judgment Day.', 'Tinsley disagreed: “That’s the Judgment Day … and there were a lot of threads that were being pulled and it was subject to unraveling at any moment.”', 'Prosecutor Creighton Waters drove his point home in his re-direct, asking Tinsley, “If the hearing takes place on June 10, 2021, what is the net effect of everything that could happen at that point?”', '“The discovery,” Tinsley said, “of everything he’s done.”', 'After the judge’s ruling the jury heard from Mushell Smith, a caregiver for Alex Murdaugh’s mother, who testified she saw Murdaugh at his parents’ home in Almeda the night of the killings.', 'That evening, Murdaugh called the house phone, told Smith he was outside and to let him in, said Smith, who was at times emotional during her testimony. Murdaugh then went into the room with his mother, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s, sat on the bed, looked at his phone and left about 20 minutes later, Smith testified. Asked to describe his behavior, Smith said Murdaugh was “fidgety.”', 'These are the names to know in the murder trial against Alex Murdaugh', 'Murdaugh’s father passed away days later, and following the funeral, the family hosted a meal at the Almeda home, she said. During the gathering, Murdaugh came into his mother’s room and spoke to Smith, she said, telling her, “I was here 30 to 40 minutes” the night of the murders.', 'The conversation upset Smith, she testified, adding she called her brother afterward to tell him about it.', 'The next day, Smith said, Murdaugh asked her about her upcoming wedding, commented that it would be expensive and offered to help. Murdaugh had never before asked her about her wedding, Smith said.', 'Three days after the funeral, Murdaugh showed up at the house again, Smith said, this time around 6:30 a.m., which was unusually early. But unlike his last unannounced visit, Murdaugh did not call the house phone to let Smith know he’d arrived. Instead, he knocked on the exterior wall by the bedroom window, she said.', 'When she let him inside, Murdaugh was carrying something in his arms, Smith said, describing it as a blue tarp. He said nothing to her, Smith said, and went upstairs. He left soon after, she said, and while Smith later saw the blue item unfolded on a chair in a room upstairs, it was gone when she returned the next day.', 'Under cross examination by defense attorney Jim Griffin, Smith told the court Murdaugh did not have blood on his clothes, shoes or in his hair when she saw him the night of the killings, also conceding that his “fidgety” behavior was normal for Murdaugh. She also acknowledged that Murdaugh’s offer to help with her wedding was something a “good person” would do.', 'Additionally, Smith conceded she did not mention the blue, tarp-like item in her interview with state investigators, on June 16, 2021. It wasn’t until she had been in a car accident in September that she mentioned the tarp to a police officer working the wreck. The officer apparently reported Smith said Murdaugh had come over the night of the murders with a blue tarp that looked like it had a gun wrapped inside, but Smith insisted she did not say that.', '“So, you didn’t tell (the officer) that he came over and you couldn’t tell, but stated, ‘It looked like a rifle,’” Griffin asked.', '“No, I said it looked like he was holding something, I did not say it was a rifle,” Smith said.', '“And if (the officer) wrote a report saying that, he was incorrect?”', '“Yes,” Smith said.”']}","{'src': ['https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230206100452-01-murdaugh-trial-0203.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230124131217-01-alex-murdaugh-trial-0123.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230206102535-01-murdaugh-trial-0206-tinsley.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill', 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210912174550-murdaugh-family.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_144,w_256,c_fill'], 'alt': ['Alex Murdaugh, center, speaks with his defense attorneys during his trial in Walterboro, South Carolina, on Friday, February 3, 2023.

Cries for his mom. 23-minute delay in aid. Here are the key revelations from the Tyre Nichols police videos', 'Five Black officers are due to be arraigned February 17 after they were fired January 20, then indicted on seven counts each, including second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct. A sixth officer, who is White, was fired and disciplined for violating policies in the Nichols case, while a seventh officer who has not been publicly identified is on administrative leave and under investigation.', 'All the fired officers were part of the force’s SCORPION unit – created to tackle rising crime in the city and disbanded amid national outcry following Nichols’ death – the department has confirmed. Those charged are accused of assaulting another young Black man three days before the Nichols encounter, states a federal lawsuit filed February 7 that also alleges the city failed to prevent or address an alleged pattern of policing abuses in the SCORPION unit; the city didn’t immediately respond, and the department wouldn’t comment.', 'Further, the charged officers are accused of internal police misconduct and policy violations – including making false statements about Nichols’ arrest and bragging about the beating – that could result in bans from other state law enforcement agencies if decertification request letters that detail the claims are granted.', 'None of the fired officers previously had been disciplined for excessive force, their personnel files show.', 'Seven more Memphis Police officers will face discipline in the wake of Nichols’ death, City Attorney Jennifer Sink said February 7. The policy violations are not criminal, she said, adding, “The investigation is ongoing. There could be more.”', 'Potential charges “of false reporting” on the initial police report remain under scrutiny, as does every other person at the scene, the district attorney’s office spokesperson Erica Williams told CNN on February 1.', 'Beyond police, three Memphis Fire Department staff were terminated and two Shelby County Sheriff’s Office deputies were put on leave for their parts in the case, leaders of those agencies have said.', 'Here’s what we know so far about those involved:', 'Bean, 24, was released on a $250,000 bond by January 27, Shelby County Jail records show. His attorney did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.', 'Bean joined the department as a recruit in August 2020 and was commissioned as an officer in January 2021, personnel records show. He was transferred to the SCORPION unit in August.', 'No previous disciplinary action involving Bean is in the personnel files reviewed by CNN.', 'Bean was initially recording his encounter with Nichols but removed his camera while the scene was still active, his decertification request letter states. He took the camera off his vest and left it on the trunk of a car before walking away to “have a conversation with other officers about the incident,” the letter says.', 'At one point, Bean and Officer Justin Smith held Nichols by the arms while other officers pepper-sprayed and “excessively struck” him with a baton, the department says.

Haley was not charged with excessive force; the other officer got a sustained complaint for “excessive/unnecessary force” and resigned, internal police records show.', 'A supervisor at the time called Haley “a hard-working officer (who) routinely makes good decisions” and said he was “sure that this was a limited event,” records show.', 'Before that, Haley had been a defendant in a 2016 federal civil suit in which a Shelby County Correctional Center inmate claimed to have been beaten and had his civil rights violated. The lawsuit was dismissed, which Haley requested, records show. CNN has reached out to Haley’s attorneys in the suit.', 'In the case, Haley was among three correctional officers said to have accused the plaintiff of trying to flush contraband and taken them to a restroom to be searched, court records show. “Haley and (a co-defendant) hit (plaintiff) in the face with punches,” the complaint states. The inmate then was picked up and slammed face-first into a sink by a third correctional officer, then thrown to the floor, after which the inmate allegedly “blacked out” and woke up in a medical unit, it states.', 'Haley and another correctional officer acknowledged searching the inmate after they “observed smoke” and the attempted flush, according to their motion to dismiss. Haley denied the other allegations, it shows.', 'Martin, 30, was released on a $350,000 bond by January 27, jail records show. He will plead not guilty, his attorney William Massey said January 26.', '“Justice means following the law, and the law says that no one is guilty until a jury says they’re guilty,” Massey said, adding, “No one out there that night intended for Tyre Nichols to die.”', 'Martin joined the department in 2018, according to personnel files.', 'Martin, who was also one of the first officers on the scene and dragged Nichols out of his car, didn’t turn his camera on before the confrontation, according to his statement of internal charges.', 'The documents do not clarify whether Martin turned on his camera the second time he encountered Nichols. He “at some point” took his camera off and put it in his car, Martin’s letter says.', 'In the following moments, after Nichols was pepper-sprayed, Martin and Haley kicked him on the ground as he was being handcuffed, the documents say.', 'In March 2019, Martin got a three-day suspension without pay after a loaded revolver was found in the back of his police car following a shift in which he transported prisoners, the records show. And he got a one-day suspension without pay after failing in September 2020 to file a report on a domestic dispute after a complainant requested such a filing.', 'Martin also earned overall praise on performance evaluations. His 2021 performance “exceeds expectations” in reliability, compatibility, work attitude and dealing with the public, personnel records show. He “uses good judgement” and “is a three-year officer performing on the same level as more mature seasoned officers,” the files said.', 'Mills, 32, was released on a $250,000 bond on January 26, according to jail records. He plans to plead not guilty, his attorney Blake Ballin said January 26.', 'Formerly a jailer in Mississippi and Tennessee, Mills is a “respectful father” who was “devastated” to be accused in Nichols’ killing, Ballin has said, adding videos of Nichols’ traffic stop “produced as many questions as they have answers.”', '“Some of the questions that remain will require a focus on Desmond Mills’s individual actions; on what Desmond knew and what he was able to see when he arrived late to the scene; on what Desmond knew and what he was able to see after he was pepper sprayed; and on whether Desmond’s actions crossed the lines that were crossed by other officers during this incident,” Ballin told CNN on January 28 in a statement.', 'Mills “is remorseful that he is attached to anything like this, that he is involved or connected to the death of somebody who – whose life should not have been taken. That is devastating to him,” Ballin told “CNN This Morning” on January 27.', '“Just because Mr. Mills was a part of that system doesn’t mean that he can’t also be a victim of it, and so it’s my job to protect him and to protect his rights,” he added. “I caution everyone to look at this with an open mind and to treat each of these officers as individuals.”', 'Mills joined the department as a recruit in March 2017, personnel files show.', 'Mills was initially recording his encounter with Nichols but removed his camera while the scene was still active, his letter states. Mills took his vest off entirely, leaving it on another car with the camera still attached, his decertification request letter says.', 'The officer also failed to immediately provide aid in the critical moments after the beating or when medical personnel asked that Nichols’ handcuffs be removed, the documents say.', 'Mills knew Nichols had been “pepper sprayed, tased, struck with an ASP baton, punched, and kicked” but didn’t provide him aid, according to the documents. Instead, he admitted in his report he walked away to decontaminate himself from the chemical irritant spray, his letter says.', 'Mills got a reprimand in 2019 for not filing a form after using physical force during an arrest to take a woman “to the ground so that she could be handcuffed,” the records show. Mills was “trying to assist the other officers to gain control of the young lady,” he said at a hearing, a summary states.', 'At a separate hearing about equipment handling, Mills’ supervisor described him as “energized and a hard worker” who had “learned his lesson” after dropping his personal digital assistant, records show.', 'Smith, 28, was released on a $250,000 bond on January 26, jail records show. His attorney did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.', 'Smith joined the department as a recruit in March 2018, personnel files show.', 'In a newly obtained sworn affidavit, Smith explained that he called for medical help and even tried to assist Nichols at one point. This represents the first account to emerge describing what an accused officer told investigators.', '“Even though no one else requested medical assistance, because of the reported taser and chemical spray, I immediately made a radio call and indicated that medical should be sent to the area where the suspect was last seen to possibly render medical aid if the suspect was taken into custody,” he said.', 'CNN could not independently confirm that Smith made that call before arriving at the scene of the second encounter.', 'At that scene, at one point Smith and Bean held Nichols by the arms while other officers pepper-sprayed and “excessively struck” him with a baton, the department says. Smith and Bean also admitted to punching Nichols several times as they tried to handcuff him, the letters say.', 'At one point, Smith suggests he attempted to help Nichols at the scene of the second encounter.', '“I informed my fellow officers to assist me in sitting the suspect against my squad car in order for the suspect to breath [sic] better,” the affidavit reads.', 'In the document, Smith did not deny failing to turn on his camera soon enough and says, “I did not intentionally fail to activate my body worn camera, but the safety of the other officers and myself was paramount,” he said.', 'The officers also failed to immediately provide aid in the critical moments after the beating or when medical personnel asked that his handcuffs be removed, despite Smith later admitting he has EMT training, the documents say.', 'In July 2021, Smith got a two-day suspension without pay for a traffic accident that January in which he hit a pickup truck with his unmarked police vehicle, causing it to spin out and hit another car, according to a police report. Smith and other drivers got minor injuries.', 'Hemphill was fired and charged departmentally – not criminally – over policy violations related to personal conduct, truthfulness and compliance with regulations governing a stun gun, uniform, inventory and recovered property processing, the Memphis Police Department said February 3.', 'In his statement on a form regarding the incident, Hemphill said Nichols attempted to grab his partner’s duty weapon. The statement was part of a decertification letter Memphis Police sent to the Tennessee Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission and obtained by CNN on February 9.', '“There is no video footage to corroborate that statement,” the letter said, adding Hemphill then provided a conflicting statement to investigators, telling them he “did not see the subject grab your partner’s gun.”', '“While we disagree with Preston Hemphill’s termination from the Memphis Police Department, Mr Hemphill will continue to cooperate with all investigating agencies into the death of Tyre Nichols,” his attorney Lee Gerald said in a February 3 statement to CNN.', 'During the initial traffic stop, Hemphill fired a stun gun at the driver and, after Nichols ran from that site, said, “One of them prongs hit the bastard,” bodycam footage released by the city shows. Twice to another officer, he says: “I hope they stomp his ass.”', 'While on top of Nichols, Hemphill “used the assaultive statement, ‘Get on the f**king ground. Finna tase yo ass,’” according to the police decertification letter.', 'Hemphill “was never present at the second scene,” Gerald said January 30, adding his client activated his bodycam as required and “is cooperating with officials in this investigation.”', 'The footage does not show Hemphill at the second site, where the district attorney has said Nichols was beaten and suffered his serious injuries.', 'Memphis Fire Department personnel terminated over their response to the Nichols encounter are: emergency medical technicians Robert Long and JaMichael Sandridge and Lt.
